# SpigotAccurateBlockPlacement
An implementation of the Carpet Accurate Block Placement Protocol for Spigot/Paper-based servers.
Adds support for FlexibleBlockPlacement from Tweakeroo and easyPlace from Litematica. Never place pistons, observers, or stairs wrong again!

Uses ProtocolLib and is compatible with Spigot/Paper 1.19.x.

# How to install
First of all make sure to install ProtocolLib: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/  
Then just download the plugin and drop it in your "plugins" folder, no configuration needed. https://github.com/DungeonDev/SpigotAccurateBlockPlacement/releases

**For Litematica**: Make sure easyPlaceProtocolVersion is set to "Version 2", then build with easyPlace like normal.  
**For Tweakeroo**: Make sure carpetAccuratePlacementProtocol is set to "true", you can then enable and use Flexible Block Placement.
